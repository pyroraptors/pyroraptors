Hey hey! I'm @pyroraptors, but I usually go by Raptor.

I'm currently learning Java and HTML.
I have previous experience with C, C#, and C++, and I wish to expand upon it in the very near future.

I am unsure of my direction in life and I am taking this time in college to explore my interests.
While gaming is a major passion of mine, I believe my best interest with either be in software development or cybersecurity. We shall see where life takes me.

I have experience with the following gaming engines:
- Unreal Engine 5 (=1 year)
- Unity (<1 year)
- OGRE (>5 years)

I often make attempts at modding games (ie. ARK and Path of Titans particularly) or making "presets/textures" for my own use in more sandbox games (ie. Impressive Title servers, FeralHeart).

I can be reached through Discord (@firechimken) or via email (tech.raptor@outlook.com), and you are likelier to reach me later at night.

Fun fact: I can play (collegiate level) a total of 3 instruments--flute, oboe, and marimba.

Fun fact #2: I am moderately conversational in German.
